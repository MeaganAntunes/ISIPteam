To Do List project

- Import all files and store (array, datamatrix, list?) for further computation:  
  STATUS: only single files import
  TODO: import with for loop into a storage

- Image normalisation:
  STATUS: croping and normalisation working
  TODO: -

- Spiral center detection - 
  STATUS: two possible implementations, results good, not perfect (i am totally ok with good)
  TODO: for perfect results another method, maybe not main focus at the moment, choosing with which one we want to go

- Electrode detection  
  STATUS: tow implementations, detects most electrodes but often one or two are outside the spiral
  TODO: for perfect results maybe mask, maybe not main focus right now?
  
- Electrode ennumeration:
   STATUS: no working function yet
   TODO: take coordinate output of electrode function and numbered coordinates as output
   
- Angle calculation:
  STATUS: working function when input of two points given
  TODO: test with real input
  
- Output results
  STATUS: no function yet
  TODO: implement function with angles and number of electrodes as input. Output should be file with list.
